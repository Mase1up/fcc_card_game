# fcc_card_game
fcc course on basic card game, trying to learn new ways to generate a deck and deal cards, AND reset the deck

Not sure this is going to be that great for what I need, but I'll try it out anyway
It WILL shuffle and randomize the four cards, but unsure about resetting things

So far, I'm very underwhelmed.  It's more like watching someone else type out code and you copy it.  He's doing a lot of things with no real explanation, just "Yeah, of course I'm doing XY and Z to set up A1, 2, and 3 later on.  

Jus not very helpful, I ought to look at other ones and see if they're better explained.
